Regression analysis
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical
processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable
(often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine
learning parlance) and one or more independent variables (often called
'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The most
common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one
finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely
fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For
example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique
Regression line for 50 random
line (or hyperplane) that minimizes the sum of squared differences
points in a Gaussian distribution
between the true data and that line (or hyperplane). For specific
around the line y=1.5x+2 (not
shown)
mathematical reasons (see linear regression), this allows the researcher
to estimate the conditional expectation (or population average value) of
the dependent variable when the independent variables take on a given
set of values. Less common forms of regression use slightly different procedures to estimate alternative
location parameters (e.g., quantile regression or Necessary Condition Analysis[1]) or estimate the
conditional expectation across a broader collection of non-linear models (e.g., nonparametric regression).
Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes. First, regression analysis is
widely used for prediction and forecasting, where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine
learning. Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal relationships between
the independent and dependent variables. Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships
between a dependent variable and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use
regressions for prediction or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify
why existing relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two
variables has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate
causal relationships using observational data.[2][3]
History
The earliest form of regression was the method of least squares, which was published by Legendre in
1805,[4] and by Gauss in 1809.[5] Legendre and Gauss both applied the method to the problem of
determining, from astronomical observations, the orbits of bodies about the Sun (mostly comets, but also
later the then newly discovered minor planets). Gauss published a further development of the theory of least
squares in 1821,[6] including a version of the Gauss–Markov theorem.
The term "regression" was coined by Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe a biological
phenomenon. The phenomenon was that the heights of descendants of tall ancestors tend to regress down
towards a normal average (a phenomenon also known as regression toward the mean).[7][8] For Galton,
regression had only this biological meaning,[9][10] but his work was later extended by Udny Yule and Karl
Pearson to a more general statistical context.[11][12] In the work of Yule and Pearson, the joint distribution
of the response and explanatory variables is assumed to be Gaussian. This assumption was weakened byR.A. Fisher in his works of 1922 and 1925.[13][14][15] Fisher assumed that the conditional distribution of
the response variable is Gaussian, but the joint distribution need not be. In this respect, Fisher's assumption
is closer to Gauss's formulation of 1821.
In the 1950s and 1960s, economists used electromechanical desk calculators to calculate regressions. Before
1970, it sometimes took up to 24 hours to receive the result from one regression.[16]
Regression methods continue to be an area of active research. In recent decades, new methods have been
developed for robust regression, regression involving correlated responses such as time series and growth
curves, regression in which the predictor (independent variable) or response variables are curves, images,
graphs, or other complex data objects, regression methods accommodating various types of missing data,
nonparametric regression, Bayesian methods for regression, regression in which the predictor variables are
measured with error, regression with more predictor variables than observations, and causal inference with
regression.
Regression model
In practice, researchers first select a model they would like to estimate and then use their chosen method
(e.g., ordinary least squares) to estimate the parameters of that model. Regression models involve the
following components:
The unknown parameters, often denoted as a scalar or vector .
The independent variables, which are observed in data and are often denoted as a vector
(where denotes a row of data).
The dependent variable, which are observed in data and often denoted using the scalar .
The error terms, which are not directly observed in data and are often denoted using the
scalar .
In various fields of application, different terminologies are used in place of dependent and independent
variables.
Most regression models propose that
is a function (regression function) of
and , with
representing an additive error term that may stand in for un-modeled determinants of or random statistical
noise:
The researchers' goal is to estimate the function
that most closely fits the data. To carry out
regression analysis, the form of the function must be specified. Sometimes the form of this function is
based on knowledge about the relationship between
and
that does not rely on the data. If no such
knowledge is available, a flexible or convenient form for is chosen. For example, a simple univariate
regression may propose
, suggesting that the researcher believes
to be a reasonable approximation for the statistical process generating the data.
Once researchers determine their preferred statistical model, different forms of regression analysis provide
tools to estimate the parameters . For example, least squares (including its most common variant, ordinary
least squares) finds the value of that minimizes the sum of squared errors
. A given
regression method will ultimately provide an estimate of , usually denoted
to distinguish the estimatefrom the true (unknown) parameter value that generated the data. Using this estimate, the researcher can
then use the fitted value
for prediction or to assess the accuracy of the model in explaining
the data. Whether the researcher is intrinsically interested in the estimate or the predicted value
will
depend on context and their goals. As described in ordinary least squares, least squares is widely used
because the estimated function
approximates the conditional expectation
.[5] However,
alternative variants (e.g., least absolute deviations or quantile regression) are useful when researchers want
to model other functions
.
It is important to note that there must be sufficient data to estimate a regression model. For example,
suppose that a researcher has access to
rows of data with one dependent and two independent variables:
. Suppose further that the researcher wants to estimate a bivariate linear model via least
squares:
. If the researcher only has access to
data points, then
they could find infinitely many combinations
that explain the data equally well: any
combination can be chosen that satisfies
, all of which lead to
and are therefore valid solutions that minimize the
sum of squared residuals. To understand why there are infinitely many options, note that the system of
equations is to be solved for 3 unknowns, which makes the system underdetermined. Alternatively,
one can visualize infinitely many 3-dimensional planes that go through
fixed points.
More generally, to estimate a least squares model with distinct parameters, one must have
distinct
data points. If
, then there does not generally exist a set of parameters that will perfectly fit the data.
The quantity
appears often in regression analysis, and is referred to as the degrees of freedom in the
model. Moreover, to estimate a least squares model, the independent variables
must
be linearly independent: one must not be able to reconstruct any of the independent variables by adding and
multiplying the remaining independent variables. As discussed in ordinary least squares, this condition
ensures that
is an invertible matrix and therefore that a unique solution exists.
Underlying assumptions
By itself, a regression is simply a calculation using the data. In order to interpret the output of regression as
a meaningful statistical quantity that measures real-world relationships, researchers often rely on a number
of classical assumptions. These assumptions often include:
The sample is representative of the population at large.
The independent variables are measured with no error.
Deviations from the model have an expected value of zero, conditional on covariates:
The variance of the residuals is constant across observations (homoscedasticity).
The residuals are uncorrelated with one another. Mathematically, the variance–covariance
matrix of the errors is diagonal.
A handful of conditions are sufficient for the least-squares estimator to possess desirable properties: in
particular, the Gauss–Markov assumptions imply that the parameter estimates will be unbiased, consistent,
and efficient in the class of linear unbiased estimators. Practitioners have developed a variety of methods to
maintain some or all of these desirable properties in real-world settings, because these classical assumptions
are unlikely to hold exactly. For example, modeling errors-in-variables can lead to reasonable estimatesindependent variables are measured with errors. Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors allow the
variance of
to change across values of
. Correlated errors that exist within subsets of the data or
follow specific patterns can be handled using clustered standard errors, geographic weighted regression, or
Newey–West standard errors, among other techniques. When rows of data correspond to locations in space,
the choice of how to model
within geographic units can have important consequences.[17][18] The
subfield of econometrics is largely focused on developing techniques that allow researchers to make
reasonable real-world conclusions in real-world settings, where classical assumptions do not hold exactly.
Linear regression
In linear regression, the model specification is that the dependent variable, is a linear combination of the
parameters (but need not be linear in the independent variables). For example, in simple linear regression
for modeling data points there is one independent variable: , and two parameters,
and :
straight line:
In multiple linear regression, there are several independent variables or functions of independent variables.
Adding a term in
to the preceding regression gives:
parabola:
This is still linear regression; although the expression on the right hand side is quadratic in the independent
variable , it is linear in the parameters ,
and
In both cases,
is an error term and the subscript indexes a particular observation.
Returning our attention to the straight line case: Given a random sample from the population, we estimate
the population parameters and obtain the sample linear regression model:
The residual,
, is the difference between the value of the dependent variable predicted by the
model, , and the true value of the dependent variable, . One method of estimation is ordinary least
squares. This method obtains parameter estimates that minimize the sum of squared residuals, SSR:
Minimization of this function results in a set of normal equations, a set of simultaneous linear equations in
the parameters, which are solved to yield the parameter estimators,
.
In the case of simple regression, the formulas for the least squares estimates are
where
is the mean (average) of the
values and
is the mean of the
values.Under the assumption that the population error term has
a constant variance, the estimate of that variance is given
by:
This is called the mean square error (MSE) of the
regression. The denominator is the sample size reduced
by the number of model parameters estimated from the
same data,
for regressors or
if
[19]
an intercept is used.
In this case,
so the
denominator is
.
Illustration of linear regression on a data set
The standard errors of the parameter estimates are given by
Under the further assumption that the population error term is normally distributed, the researcher can use
these estimated standard errors to create confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests about the
population parameters.
General linear model
In the more general multiple regression model, there are
independent variables:
where
is the -th observation on the -th independent variable. If the first independent variable takes the
value 1 for all ,
, then
is called the regression intercept.
The least squares parameter estimates are obtained from
The normal equations are

Diagnostics
Once a regression model has been constructed, it may be important to confirm the goodness of fit of the
model and the statistical significance of the estimated parameters. Commonly used checks of goodness of fit
include the R-squared, analyses of the pattern of residuals and hypothesis testing. Statistical significance can
be checked by an F-test of the overall fit, followed by t-tests of individual parameters.
Interpretations of these diagnostic tests rest heavily on the model's assumptions. Although examination of
the residuals can be used to invalidate a model, the results of a t-test or F-test are sometimes more difficult to
interpret if the model's assumptions are violated. For example, if the error term does not have a normal
distribution, in small samples the estimated parameters will not follow normal distributions and complicate
inference. With relatively large samples, however, a central limit theorem can be invoked such that
hypothesis testing may proceed using asymptotic approximations.
Limited dependent variables
Limited dependent variables, which are response variables that are categorical variables or are variables
constrained to fall only in a certain range, often arise in econometrics.
The response variable may be non-continuous ("limited" to lie on some subset of the real line). For binary
(zero or one) variables, if analysis proceeds with least-squares linear regression, the model is called the
linear probability model. Nonlinear models for binary dependent variables include the probit and logit
model. The multivariate probit model is a standard method of estimating a joint relationship between several
binary dependent variables and some independent variables. For categorical variables with more than two
values there is the multinomial logit. For ordinal variables with more than two values, there are the ordered
logit and ordered probit models. Censored regression models may be used when the dependent variable is
only sometimes observed, and Heckman correction type models may be used when the sample is not
randomly selected from the population of interest. An alternative to such procedures is linear regression
based on polychoric correlation (or polyserial correlations) between the categorical variables. Such
procedures differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the variables in the population. If the
variable is positive with low values and represents the repetition of the occurrence of an event, then count
models like the Poisson regression or the negative binomial model may be used.
Nonlinear regression
When the model function is not linear in the parameters, the sum of squares must be minimized by an
iterative procedure. This introduces many complications which are summarized in Differences between
linear and non-linear least squares.
Prediction (interpolation and extrapolation)Regression models predict a value of the Y
variable given known values of the X variables.
Prediction within the range of values in the dataset
used for model-fitting is known informally as
interpolation. Prediction outside this range of the
data is known as extrapolation. Performing
extrapolation relies strongly on the regression
assumptions. The further the extrapolation goes
outside the data, the more room there is for the
model to fail due to differences between the
assumptions and the sample data or the true
values.
A prediction interval that represents the
uncertainty may accompany the point prediction.
Such intervals tend to expand rapidly as the values
of the independent variable(s) moved outside the
range covered by the observed data.
In the middle, the interpolated straight line represents
the best balance between the points above and below
this line. The dotted lines represent the two extreme
lines. The first curves represent the estimated values.
The outer curves represent a prediction for a new
measurement.[20]
For such reasons and others, some tend to say that it might be unwise to undertake extrapolation.[21]
However, this does not cover the full set of modeling errors that may be made: in particular, the assumption
of a particular form for the relation between Y and X. A properly conducted regression analysis will include
an assessment of how well the assumed form is matched by the observed data, but it can only do so within
the range of values of the independent variables actually available. This means that any extrapolation is
particularly reliant on the assumptions being made about the structural form of the regression relationship. If
this knowledge includes the fact that the dependent variable cannot go outside a certain range of values, this
can be made use of in selecting the model – even if the observed dataset has no values particularly near
such bounds. The implications of this step of choosing an appropriate functional form for the regression can
be great when extrapolation is considered. At a minimum, it can ensure that any extrapolation arising from a
fitted model is "realistic" (or in accord with what is known).
Power and sample size calculations
There are no generally agreed methods for relating the number of observations versus the number of
independent variables in the model. One method conjectured by Good and Hardin is
, where is
the sample size, is the number of independent variables and
is the number of observations needed to
reach the desired precision if the model had only one independent variable.[22] For example, a researcher is
building a linear regression model using a dataset that contains 1000 patients ( ). If the researcher decides
that five observations are needed to precisely define a straight line ( ), then the maximum number of
independent variables the model can support is 4, because
.
Other methodsAlthough the parameters of a regression model are usually estimated using the method of least squares,
other methods which have been used include:
Bayesian methods, e.g. Bayesian linear regression
Percentage regression, for situations where reducing percentage errors is deemed more
appropriate.[23]
Least absolute deviations, which is more robust in the presence of outliers, leading to
quantile regression
Nonparametric regression, requires a large number of observations and is computationally
intensive
Scenario optimization, leading to interval predictor models
Distance metric learning, which is learned by the search of a meaningful distance metric in a
given input space.[24]
Software
All major statistical software packages perform least squares regression analysis and inference. Simple
linear regression and multiple regression using least squares can be done in some spreadsheet applications
and on some calculators. While many statistical software packages can perform various types of
nonparametric and robust regression, these methods are less standardized. Different software packages
implement different methods, and a method with a given name may be implemented differently in different
packages. Specialized regression software has been developed for use in fields such as survey analysis and
neuroimaging.
