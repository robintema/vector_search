Rule-based machine learning
Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a term in computer science intended to encompass any machine
learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves 'rules' to store, manipulate or apply.[1][2][3] The defining
characteristic of a rule-based machine learner is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules
that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system.
Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems,[4] association rule learning,[5]
artificial immune systems,[6] and any other method that relies on a set of rules, each covering contextual
knowledge.
While rule-based machine learning is conceptually a type of rule-based system, it is distinct from traditional
rule-based systems, which are often hand-crafted, and other rule-based decision makers. This is because
rule-based machine learning applies some form of learning algorithm to automatically identify useful rules,
rather than a human needing to apply prior domain knowledge to manually construct rules and curate a rule
set.
RulesRules typically take the form of an '{IF:THEN} expression', (e.g. {IF 'condition' THEN 'result'}, or as a
more specific example, {IF 'red' AND 'octagon' THEN 'stop-sign}). An individual rule is not in itself a
model, since the rule is only applicable when its condition is satisfied. Therefore rule-based machine
learning methods typically comprise a set of rules, or knowledge base, that collectively make up the
prediction model.
